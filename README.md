# 🚀 DSA-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from platforms like **LeetCode, CodingNinjas, CodeChef, GeeksforGeeks, and more**. I am solving these problems to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews. I will be updating this repository daily and try to cover all the DSA problems that is important with respect to interviews and OAs.
