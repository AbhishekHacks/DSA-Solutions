/*Ninja is shifting to a new place named NinjaGram. To take admission to the new school, the teacher gives him a sentence and asks him to check whether the sentence is a pangram.

A word or a sentence is called a pangram if it contains all the English alphabet letters.

Since Ninja is new to programming, he doesnâ€™t have much experience; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help Ninja figure out whether the sentence is a pangram?*/
