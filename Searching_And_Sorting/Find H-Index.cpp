/*You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcherâ€™s H-index.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.*/
