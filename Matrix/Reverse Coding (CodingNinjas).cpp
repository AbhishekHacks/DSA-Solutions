/*As a part of its annual techno-cultural fest, NinjaCity will conduct a technical event, Decode, where it has given a matrix, and the participants have to decode it.

The participants are given a N*M matrix; they need to print the rows in reverse order. Do this for every row.

Among the participants, a participant named Ninja is new to programming and doesnâ€™t have much experience; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help Ninja reverse all the rows in reverse order?*/
